00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:06.881
<u>So, Fair phones look like this.</u>

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:10.010
I would say parents use these more
frequently to give to their children.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.095
Definitely functional
but they’ve lived a little.

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:13.513
<u>A Good phone looks like this.</u>

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.266 align:right line:0
They may have light micro-scratches that are not visible

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.976
from a distance of twenty inches.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.311
What does that really look like?
You won’t really notice it.

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:24.024
We recommend using a smartphone case
so that A) it’s better for the planet

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.277
but B) you really won’t notice
any of those micro-scratches.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.404
An Excellent phone looks like this
and I don’t know about you,

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:32.365
but I can’t tell the difference between
an Excellent phone and a brand new phone.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.245
